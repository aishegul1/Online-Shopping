# Online-Shopping
JAVA PRACTICE

This is a Java program that simulates an online shopping website. It has a main method that initializes two lists; listOfProduct and productprices, which store the product names and their corresponding prices, respectively. It then adds new products and their prices to the lists.

The program prompts the user to enter the product code and the number of items they want to buy using the Scanner class. It then calculates the total cost of the items and adds it to the amountofpayment variable. The user is then asked if they want to continue shopping or proceed to payment.

The program has three helper methods:

showListOfProducts() - This method displays the list of products and their prices.
continueOrNo() - This method prompts the user to continue shopping or proceed to payment.
pay() - This method displays a welcome message if it is the establishment day of the online shopping website or displays a thank you message and the total amount due if the user decides to proceed to payment.
The program also has a slowPrint() method that prints out text character by character, with a delay specified in milliseconds, to simulate the effect of a typewriter.
